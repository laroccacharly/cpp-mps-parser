1. Define Requirements and Scope
MPS File Parser Details:
Understand the MPS file format, its sections, and constraints.
List the parserâ€™s responsibilities (e.g., reading file headers, constraints, objective function, etc.).
Identify error handling and edge cases (e.g., incomplete files, non-standard formatting).
Sparse Matrix Support:
Determine the operations you expect on the parsed data.
Research potential libraries like Eigen (which is header-only and supports sparse matrices) or other specialized sparse matrix libraries if more complex operations are required.
TDD Approach:
Define unit tests for every parser component.
Identify integration tests, ensuring that parsed data correctly constructs sparse matrix representations.
2. Project Setup
Version Control:
Initialize a Git repository.
Set up branching strategies (e.g., feature branches, development/main branches).
Build System:
Use CMake for cross-platform build configuration.

Dependency Selection
Sparse Matrix Library:
Eigen: It is a well-documented, header-only library with good support for dense and sparse matrices.
Alternatively, consider other libraries if needed, ensuring they can integrate with your build system.
Testing Framework:
GoogleTest: Widely used for C++ TDD, easy integration with CMake.

Test Driven Development (TDD) Strategy
Initial Test Cases:
Write tests for valid MPS file parsing (covering the typical case).
Write tests for erroneous cases (e.g., malformed files, missing sections).
Write tests that verify intermediate data structures (e.g., matrix representations) after conversion using the sparse matrix library.
Iterative Development:
Start by writing a failing test (e.g., for reading a simple valid MPS file).
Implement minimal parser code to pass the test.
Refactor the code, add more detailed tests, and incrementally add features.
Consider using mocking where necessary (i.e., for file I/O or external dependencies).
Test Coverage:
Identify all critical functions/modules.
Ensure tests cover boundary conditions and error handling.
5. Build System and Continuous Integration
CMake Configuration:
Configure separate targets for the parser library and the tests.
Define options to automatically include the third-party libraries (e.g., Eigen, GoogleTest).
